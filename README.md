Hi! I'm Ethan. I'm passionate about contributing to academic literature and creative problem solving.

My math reserach focus is on riemannian geometry, with a focus on the generalized cartan hadamard conjecture.
This involves mathematics that falls broadly under differential geometry, geometric measure theory, and some algbera.

My ML reserach is in discrete diffusion models; specifically sampling.
This is mostly a theory project, and considers most classical diffusion math.

I am also interested in algorithms, specifcally algoritms involivng geometry for learning or optimization. 

Academics aside, I enjoy reading, photography, philosphy, and listening to a lot of music.
