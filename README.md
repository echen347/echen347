Hi! I'm Ethan. I'm passionate about contributing to academic literature and creative problem solving.

$\text{My reserach focus is on riemannian geometry, with a focus on the generalized cartan hadamard conjecture.}$
$\text{This involves mathematics that falls broadly under differential geometry, geometric measure theory, and some algbera.}$
$\text{Recently, I've gained interest in probabilty and other measure theoretic topics, including discrete harmonic analysis.}$
$\text{I hope to learn more about these topics in the future.}$


$$\text{interests}_{mathematics} := \\{ \text{geometry}, \text{probabilty}, \text{number theory} \\}$$

My intersts in computer science lie mostly in the theortical aspect (as to be expected).
Algorithms are of particular interest, specifcally algoritms involivng geometry for learning or optimization.

I also am tangetially interested (due to a large % of my friends sharing this interest) in machine learning.
My specific interests lie in classical DL but I am open to learning more about other subfields.

`interests_compsci = {algorithms, optimization, deep learning}`

Academics aside, I enjoy reading, photography, philosphy, and listening to a lot of music.
