Hi! I'm Ethan. I'm passionate about creative problem solving and contributing to academic literature.

My research can be summarized as applying difficult math to improve sampling algorithms and generative models on complex spaces.

Academics aside, I enjoy reading, photography, philosphy, and listening to a lot of music.
