Hi! I’m Ethan.

I’m passionate about reasoning from first principles and creative problem solving.

My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of sampling algorithms and structure-preserving generative models.

Academics aside, I enjoy reading, photography, philosophy, and listening to a lot of music.

I made a fully functional neural network in desmos.
